#TODOS

This is stuff I know we want to implement or clean up soon:

- combat abilities (base abilities (skills), class abilities)
- using combat abilities out of combat (initiating combat)
- classes (base stats and levelup improvements, including table of abilities by level)
- energy system and exhaustion
- extra empty lines in the text readouts
