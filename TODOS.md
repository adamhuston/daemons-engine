# TODOS

This is just an informal log of stuff I know we want to implement or clean up soon and don't want to forget about:

## Uncategorized TODOS

- combat abilities (base abilities (skills), class abilities)
- using combat abilities out of combat (initiating combat)
- classes (base stats and levelup improvements, including table of abilities by level)
- energy system and exhaustion
- extra empty lines in the text readouts
- player interaction: whispers and yelling
- NPC behaviors - really check every single one of them and make sure they're working as intended

## Dungeon content creator app TODOS
- api for content management system
- client for content management system

## Worldbuilding TODOS
- let's do some creative fiction, man
- Also, if we give an LLM the documentation for our API, can it be a good dungeon builder?
